Automatically convert websites generated by websitedoneforyou.com.au to static HTML.

Melbourne IT's website builder does not have an eject or export option. So instead,
you can clone your site with wget and then run this script to pull dependencies locally
and updated the linkages.


```bash
npm install
./wdfy-convert.js /path/tp/wget/clone
```
